* Fate is fragile.
  * Eventhough many things remain out of our control, and prediction of the future is not possible, we can however capitalise on the predictability of human behavior.
  * Humans behave in certains predictable ways when faced with uncertainty, grief or sadness and we can leverage this knowledge.
* The greatest risk is overlooking risk
  * Risk is what is left over after we think we have thought of everything. Due to world being vastly uncertain, unwanted outcomes can come up.
  * Like an astronaut drowning in the water after successful space mission, we can focus on a task so much that we overlook some places that we fail.
  * Broad preparedness is necessary.
* Low expectations are a key to happiness
  * Happiness has less to do with circumstances and more to do with expectations.
  * Expectations keep rising with development. Hedonic treadmill. Rising inequality.
  * The rule of a happy life is lower expectations consciously.
  * Compare less, appericiate what you have and acknowledge material and wealth often fail to meet expectations.
  * Realistic perspective keeps us happy.
* Certainity kills accuracy
  * We always cling to certainty and are attracted to things that remove doubt and uncertainty.
  * We need to be aware of the probabilities of events and avoid our bias towards certainty.
* Stories over stats
  * Stats and logic tell only one side of events. How things will turn out also depend on emotional and social element.
  * Stories, annecdotes and social dialogue can change outcomes in ways that defy stats and logic.
  * People are captured by stories and that gives tremendous leverage to powerful storytellers.
* The tortoise and the hare
  * Progress creeps along slowly and goes unnoticed whereas failure strike quickly and is attention grabbing.
  * We take for granted the benefits of progress and focus more on the drawbacks of failure.
  * Compounding micro benefits over the long haul is better than, failing big and fast.
* Different experiences
  * Other people having different life experiences have opinions different from other people.
  * This can lead to disagreements and arguments. Knowing the circumstances which shaped those decisions can help us empathise with others.
