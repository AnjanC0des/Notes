### User Notes

* What I observed is that we must not only able to work with different types of graphs but also be able to play around with the data to make conclusions. When we notice different ways we can play around with the data and start doing it ourself it'll eventually become second nature.
* **Mean, median and mode**:
  * Mean is the average of all the values.
  * Median is the middle most value when the values are sorted.
  * Mode is the most occuring value.
* **Range** is the difference between the highest and lowest values. 
* **Midrange** is the mean of the highest and lowest values.

## Analyzing one categorical variables
### Identifying individuals and variables

* A data set consists of rows and columns. The rows describe a certain data point which is described by the values in the columns associated by that row.
* The rows of data that each represent a data point is called as a **individual**.
* The column of data that describe the individual is called as a **variable**.
* Variables containing categorical data,i.e., data that can be put in buckets of categories are called **categorical variables** and variables that are described in terms of a quantitative value are called as **quantitative variables**.

* In this example, Ben Beans drinks are the individuals and this data set contains 4 variables with one varible being categorical and the rest being quantitative.
* We must be able to describe how many variables an individual has along with the type of each variable(categorical/quantitative).

### Reading a pictograph

* It is a graph where the data is shown in terms of pictures in rows and each pic denotes some quantitative value.

-> Insert image here <-

* Here each drop of blood denotes 8 people.
* We must be comfortable quickly using the pics and quickly converting them to actual quantites after doing some calculation.
* For e.g., we must be able to find the total values in each category, difference between them or quantity left if sum total is given.

### Reading bar graphs

* In this type of graph one axis contains individuals and other axis contains value for a variable. Each bar represents a value for an individual and an individual may contain mutiple bars.

* In this image from the difference between the mid and end sem marks we can see that Alejandra has the most improvement in the two exams.
* By looking at the data we must quickly know which bars denote which individual and also have an idea of the scale of the data.
* We must also be able to calculate different central tendency metrics like mean, median and mode and things like range and midrange.

### Reading pie graphs

* Pie charts are circular graphs where each individual is represented as a part of a whole pie and its percentage is mentioned in it.

## Two way tables 

### Two way frequency tables and venn diagrams

* Freaquency tables are a way to show data which reflects the association or lack of wrt some variable/variables.
* Venn diagram is same as a frequency table but shows the relations diagramatically.

* Here is a illustration showing vann diagrams and frequency tables wrt to candies that contains or dont contain chocolate and coconut.

* There are also two way frequency tables which show the data similar to a frequency table but as a percentage of total of a column.

* Something to note here is, when you have row relative freaquency table, unless you have total values you cannot compare the likelyhood of occurence along the columns. Similarly we cannot compare likelyhood along rows for a column relative frequency table.
