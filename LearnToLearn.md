## Introduction

**What is need to learn more effetively?**

* Learning is the single most important thing that humans can do beside their biological and social activities to have a fruitful and satifactory life. 
* Eventhough learning has been one of the most beneficial activity since the dawn of humanity and humans learn instinctually and pick up things that seemed intuitive to them and develop their skills on activites the came naturally to them.
* But internet has changed that. Internet gives you access to vast amounts of information.This can be both beneficial and harmful, since helpful information can help us develop skills, become more informed and upgrade ourselves in general, overstimulation from apps and games affect our attention spans and messes with the natural reward system that we have making self developing activites less exciting and slows down our growth. 
* We have reached a point where we need to learn how to learn more effectivly to make ourselves capable of learning a plathora of things and apply them as is the need of the hour.
* Many techniques and their application methods are outlined here.
* Learning fast, synthesising, applying, training to keep ourselves absorbed and
making sure we are doing it the best possible way is the aim.

## The Lifestyle
* Making ourselves ready to learn is one of the most important steps.
* Prepping the brain to perform better is obvious but often overlooked.
* Learning is more than just sitting at a place and focusing to figure out stuff. To do it like a superpower we need to cultivate it as such.
* To do things which are beneficial to us, we must learn to let go of things that are not.

> Treat your brain like a F1 car. Drop all the un-necessary weight and work on it to make it faster and more powerful.

* This begins with stopping unnecessary thought. Gossip, negative thoughts, any emotional thought that is negative, thoughts of past, arguments, emotional investment in things that dont matter etc are all slowing you down. Train your brain to be light on its feet.

> Like we cannot expect a bountiful harvest in barren and rocky soil, like we cannot expect to have a godly physique without going to the gym, similarly the mind needs to be in a certain way to perform best.

* We need to follow certain lifestyle that avoids stimulation as much as possible. This is necessary because stimulating activities capture and hold attention faster and longer period of time than activities like studying. We cannot sit down and prepare a budget when 12 differnt people are tapping us on the shoulder and shouting gossip into our ears.
* This involves making a deliberate and consious effort to turn off the voice in our brain. Besides other life changing benefits, it makes our brain more responsive and calm.
* To reinforce this we need avoid stimulation and make a habit of pursuing less stimulating activities.
* Adult content, reel/shorts, games, gossip, anything that gives that sudden jolt of adrenaline must be avoided. They form bad habit that not only hinder good brain activity but also amount to nothing. Your brain mistakes stimulation for happiness and gets trapped.

> Bad habit forming and overstimulating things are the true doom that no one realises. Even the best techniques will fail if you dont find things rewarding. Thats brain for you. Indulge in these things enough and you'll find your happiness being seized by them.

* Reading books, learnging new language, figuring out personal finance and such activites are the money.
* Doing things that you consider boring but are good for you should be persued.
* In addition to this, we cultivate a sense of timeless-ness. Turning away from all clocks, being absorbed in the activity for hours on end is the key. To train yourself, for example, read a book till you are bored and cant consiously concentrate. Imagine turning off your brain for a second and start reading as if you have just started the activity.
* This, when becomes a habit, will help you spend large amounts of time doing brain intensive tasks minimising loss of focus and interest.
* We need to find something to love in the things that we do. Be it reading books to gain experiences of countless people though their work, or learning maths and statistics and making intresting and actionable discoveries, or developing a software that helps you accomplish something. The more genuinly you love something and find ways in which it is intresting and amazing, you'll be able to do it effortlessly and enjoyably. Do stuff for the sake of doing it and for the love of it. Youll be surprised by the happiness that they give you and life feels less blande and more rewarding since we do activities that improves us.
* If it were a different time, these things would come naturally to us because the brain would have been less preoccupied and badly stimulated. Nonetheless, through practice we can learn to discover hapiness again.
* In the journey to be better and making yourself better, you'll discover many different ways to make yourself even better. It is good practice to maintain a journal to record everything, so that you can come back to realign or rediscover. Also writings things down makes us to come to terms with things in our lives and organise our thoughts that will otherwise be running around.

## The Method
* We must be in a mindset of putting in work for indefinite amount of time when we sit to study. When we dismiss the assocation of work with the duration of time we do it, our work is less hindered 
* We have to switch our minds from the normal monkey-mode to input-mode. The act of making a consious effort to make our brain impressionable to input and supplementing the process with different activities to make the information stick is the aim.
* This is essential, because what we do on instinct is make our brain churn out information in response to the information it recieves in real time. This activity needs to be consciously stopped and made a habit out of eventually. Because you dont have to think to
respond to the information you are recieving, since you are just recieving it, but we forget this out of habit.
* Everything that we try to learn and understand can be done so even more effectively if we are actively putting in more thought into it.
* The more we are invested and intrested in something, easier it will be for us to enagage and stay focused on the subject. Try to develop a bond with subject as you learn.F
* Visualizing the knowledge that we come accross helps us make it stick. We must be conscious of it and do it more often. With repetition this will come naturally and become a good habit.
* You must be seated somewhere that has no distractions in your field of view. Sitting somewhere silent/with noise cancelling head phones is best practice.

## The Tools
### Deep Concentration and Flow

> Imagine the feeling of sitting in an exam hall and attempting a paper. You keep answering the questions in your answer sheet and when you check the clock, a lot of time has passed.

* This is due to the immersion and focus that you have invested in the activity that you start to do disassociate yourself with your surroundings and time and become absorbed in the activity.
* This total immersion/absroption into an activity that you ignore all external phenomena is called **Deep concentration**.
* With no distractions, a calm focused mind and a challenging task that makes us invested to solve the problem we can enter a state of deep concetration called **flow state**.
* Flow state is being engaged in the task at hand for elongated peroid of time without break in focus. The activity is the only thing on our minds so we do the activity by not thinking about anything else.
* When we are invested in the activity because we find it **intresting or we gain some reward out of it**, it becomes more **easy to enter the flow state**. Through practice we can effortlessly enter it and this makes us tremendously productive.
* To keep the efficiency high it is beneficial to disenegage the thought pedal from time to time. This way you extend the duration of flow and also make your brain more acquainted with the thought process while you do it making it easier to do.
* This technique is essentially the application of the **Pomodoro technique**.
* Pomodoro Technique is a technique where we focus intensly on a task for say 25 min and disengage for 5 mins and re-engage. This makes us more efficient.
* If we begin to feel our attention wavering or we feel unintrested in a task, we can just think that we have just started doing the task and this makes us continue on our work.
* We should block all distractions during flow.
* With practice entering flow will become effortless and we will be able to be engaged in tasks for longer and more efficiency.

### Spaced Repetition

> Remember the DSA questions that you used to review every morning? Everytime you encounted a problem that was built on top of that problem or was a variation of it, you could readily remember and use it.

* When we study something in spaced intervals and as the number of repetitions increase, we find it more easy to actively recall the information and retain it in our memory. To do this we must revisit the concepts in regular intervals so our brain gets accustomed to the information.
* We do this by writing the stuff down on paper, making notes, flash cards or quizzes. The more we revisit the information, it will retain in our memory more easily.
* We will be able to recall the concepts more actively, which results in better grasp of topics that build on it or related to it and making it easier and quicker to remember.
* While learning concepts or languages that we are not acquainted with spaced repetition is an excellent tool.
* It is immensly useful with learning new languages, learning difficult concepts, etc. since it deepens the neural pathways and make our brain more aquainted to the information/concept.

### Metacognition

* Metacognition is the term referred to thinking about the way you are approaching a process to do the process in a better manner.
* In learning you use metacognition techniques to ensure that you are learning in the right way and achieving results as intended.
* This includes if three stages:
   * **Planning the process** : We plan how we are going to approach a topic and making detailed milestones to achieve
   * **Evaluating your actions in real time** : Taking a step back and assessing the way we are doing the process making sure we have clarity on the subject.
   * **Assessing the results and reflecting on them** : After the learning process is complete, we reflect on how it was helpful, what worked, what didnt and how we can improve the process.
* We assume the roles of architect, detective and judge of ourselves, and plan, assess and judge ourselves from a third person perspective.
* We must keep in mind the ways how learning can be made more potent(like proper learning techniques), make sure to have positive associations and processes to make the information stick.
* Different metacognition activities include:
  * **Reflective writing** : journaling about the work to have feedback and clarity of our actions
  * **Summarization** : Making sure we can summarize and explain the learned concepts in simple manner
  * **Self questioning** : Questioning ourself and ensuring we are proceeding as planned and maximizing efficiency
  * **Visual Aids** : Visualizing concepts and having visual representation of our learning process or concepts themselves that can aid in the process
* Thinking about how we think can help us follow proper path and recieve the results we desire while improving our learning process.

## Biases 

> Notice that one sneaker on a shopping site and all of a sudden you are starting to see more of those everywhere!

* When learning, we must ensure we are not being biased to ensure our learning is more hollistic and complete.
* There are a bunch of biases that we need to look out for to avoid falling into them and limiting ourselves.
* Most common biases are as follows :
  * **Confirmation bias** : We always seek out and confirm our preexisting beliefs and ignore information that doesnot align with our belief system.
  * **Halo effect** : When we like something about someone we are more likely from a positive impression on them as a whole.
  * **Availability Heuristic** : We rely on information that is readily available even if that information is partial.
  * **Hindsight bias** : We think of events that have happened or we have observed to be more predictable than they actually are.
  * **Anchoring bias** : We tend to rely on the information that we get first the most.
  * **Sunk cost fallacy** : We tend to remain engaged and attached to things that we invested our time, money or efforts in even if they are not useful or even detrimental to us.
  * **Framing effect** : We are influenced by the way the information is presented rather than the information itself.
  * **Self serving bias** : We attribute our successes as the result of our own efforts and our failures as things beyond our control.
* During the learning process if we actively watch out for our biases we can avoid them.
* We can make use of active questioning and reflective writing to ensure our learning process is unbiased.
* We need to have a growth mindset to be unbiased and perform more effectively. Growth mindset includes :
  * **Knowing our biases** : When we know the things we are biased towards we actively take impartial decisions.
  * **Seeking diverses perspectives** : We must see the process or problems for different angles and perspectives keeping our biases in mind to see what is actually correct.
  * **Embracing challenges** : We need to have zeal and drive towards breaking our biases and with time we will be less affected by them.
  * **Critical thinking and providing feedback** : Questioning our actions and thinking critically during the process can help us avoid biased decision making. Having feedback of our performance can improve our critical thinking and improve our decision making. 
  * **Praising efforts and persistence** : We must acknowledge our best efforts and persistence. Acknowledging ourselves make us more motivated towards our goals and following correct process.
  * **Promoting self reflection** : When we actively evaluate ourselves, think of ways we can do it better next time, see what worked and what didn't, we improve our learning and decision making process.
  * **Power of yet** : When we acknowledge that we are unable to do something presently we also open up ourselves to better ourselves and eventually succeed at the task.
* When we have an unbiased mind and growth mindset we can achieve greater performance, resilience and positive outlook which boosts our morale and confidence in our positive behaviors.

### Dos and Don'ts 

#### Dos

* **Feynman Technique** is proven to improve our understanding of the topic and make it stick. The technqiue involves rephrasing.
* We must be as engaged while studying as if we are attempting an examination paper under a time crunch.
* We must set clear and achievable goals and must pursue them sincerly.
* Being consistent with our studying habit is important since the benefits for being consistent compounds over time.

> We must pick our trade and stick to it. When we pick studying as our trade, we can master all others.

* We must think critically and follow metacognition techniques as well as reflecting on our activities as we do them. This we make sure we stay on track.
* Bright surroundings, binaural beats and white noise are known to improve focus and engagement in the activity.
* Not revisiting information from time to time makes that info decay in our memory. We must implement spaced repetition for important informtion.
* **Cognitive Load Theory** states that, as the complexity of a task or information increases we as less likely to stay engaged in it and our learning ability decreases. We must use techniques like Feynman technique to digest the information properly and make it stick.
* Passive Consumption must be avoided. Things that are consumed passively dont tend to stick and decay faster. Summarization, rephrasing, self testing, spaced-repeating and implementing are ways to make the information stick.
* Memorizing without understanding should be avoided as well, since that information cannot be implemented properly and also decays rapidly.

> Procrastination is the ultimate mind killer. It cripples your mind from learning. It prevents the mind from doing what it is made to do.

* Procrastination should be beaten at all costs. Whenever you have to do something important, just get up and do it. When you wait to do it, you are reinforcing your procrastinating habit. Procrastination leads to unnecessary stress and eventually mental crisis as your goals stay unfulfilled.
* Lack of interest or motivation must be checked. We need to find reasons for learning or doing something and what it serves us in the long run. When we are more invested in the topic, we are more likely to pursue it efficiently and implement it. Here we use **sunk cost fallacy** to our advantage.
* We must never forget using metacognition techniques are they are the test of our learning health.
